# PyTrends Demo

The notebook in this repository is being presented at a PyLadies Meetup and a Practical Data Science Meetup in Salt Lake City.

Thanks to [General Mills](https://github.com/GeneralMills) for supporting the unofficial Google Trends API [PyTrends](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends), and of course Google, for making some of their search data publicly available through [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/).
